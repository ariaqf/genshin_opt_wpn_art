This is a solver for artifact/weapon stats optmization for GEnshin impact characters, the specific wepons/characters must be added by the user.

It supports constraints so you can set a minimum ER/EM/DEF/HP or use those to setup your custom fit function. 

The fit function will be used to calculate damage as it was the objective of this optmization, and the current function is set to work for a specific Diluc rotation.
